1.use union to connect two different select sentence,but they need have the same number of columns.
	eg:	select cust_name,cust_contact,cust_email

		from customers

		where cust_state in ('IL','IN','MI')

		union

		select cust_name,cust_contact,cust_email

		from customers
		
where cust_name = 'Fun4All'

	#the default condition is 'distinct' which means omit repeated lines,
	can use 'union all' to show all lines contain repeated lines.
