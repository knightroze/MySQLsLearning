1.insert
	insert into customers values ('1000000006','Toy Land','123 Any Street','New York','NY','11111','USA',NULL,NULL)
	#the inserted value must have the same number as the destination sheet.

	#another way is to explicitly choose the mapping relation between columns and values.
	insert into customers(id,contact,email,name,address,city,state,zip)
	values	('1000000006','ToyLand','123AnyStreet','NewYork','NY','11111','USA',NULL,NULL)

2.insert the select
	insert into customers(A) select (B) from custnew
	#pay attention to that the insert value can't have the same key to any of the sheet.
	#A can equal to B or not equal, the database only want to know the order.

3.select and insert
	create table custcopy as select * from customers
	
	#first create a new table and then use select to definate it.


4.update
	update customers 
	set cust_mail = 'a@123.com' ,
	    aother_columns = some value,
	    ...
	where cust_id = '10000000005';

	#you can set some columns of one line at one time,use commas to seperate them.


5.delete
	delete from customers where cust_id='10000000006'
	
	#this sentence can delete the line whose id=10000000006, if there is no where, all the sheet would be deleted



6.create
	create table products
	(
	columns          datatype      not NULL or NULL     default_value ,
	prod_id          char(10)      not NULL		    default 1,	
	prod_id2          char(10)      not NULL,
	);
	
	#first the sheet name mustn't be an exist sheet's name,and second if a colomn is not NULL means the value can't be NULL.The last one is default ,can use it to definate a default value but can also omit default.

7.alter 
	alter table vendors add vend_phone char(20)
	#this can add a new column

	alter table vendors drop column vend_phone
	#this will delete the vend_phone
	#if you want to delete the whole table use this
		drop table custcopy

8.create view
	#view is a table without data
	create view productcustomers as
	select cust_name, cust_contact,prod_id
	from customers,orders,orderitems
	where customers.cust_id = orders.cust_id and orderitems.order_num = orders.order_num;
	
	#after create a view, you can directly select from it.So it means that you can save a query result as a view for using soon.r


9.primary key and references
	#primary key can't be update after defination and every line should have a primary key.
	eg: create table abc(
		vend_id char(10) not NULL primary key,
		...
		)
	eg: alter table vendors add constraint primary key (vend_id)

	#reference key is a value which related with another sheet's column value
	eg: create table abc(
		vend_id char(10) not NULL references customers(cust_id),
		...
		)
	eg: alter table orders add constraint foreign key(cust_id)references customers (cust_id)
	#the related sheet can be itself or another different sheet.

10.data check
	#constraint or rule that the data must obey
	
	create table orderitems
	(
		quantity integer not NULL check (quantity>0),
		...
	)
