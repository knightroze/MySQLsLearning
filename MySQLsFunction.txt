some math function:
abs
cos
exp
pi
sin
sqrt
tan


aggregate function
avg(column):return the average, can use "where" to limit the range.
		eg: select avg(price) from product where id='001'
count(*|filed):return the number of selected filed.
		eg: select count(email) ans num_email from customer
max,min,sum is as the same as count

All above five functions have two attributes: all and distinct, if choose distinct, the function would omit the repeated value.
		eg:select avg(distinct price) as avg_price from XXX


summary eg:
select count(*) as num_items,min(price) as min,max(price) as max,avg(price) as avg from products .
